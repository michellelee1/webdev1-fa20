    <h1>The Good, the Bad, and the Internet</h1>
    <p>The internet is a very resourceful tool to have because itâ€™s accessible and universal.  The internet has made the world a smaller place. People are no longer enclosed in their small communities, but they are given global access to different people and cultures.  However, there is a dark side to the internet, such as trolls and anonymity to illegal activities.</p>

    <p>There are many pros and cons in regard to the internet that we should consider.</p>

        <li>Information is available at your fingertips</li>
        <li>People can connect with one another more often through social media</li>
        <li>More entrepreneurial opportunities available for small and large businesses</li>
        <li>Digital payments increase the speed of monetary transactions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cons</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal privacy is more vulnerable</li>
        <li>Anonymity can be dangerous and online trolls</li>
        <li>It can become an addiction</li>
        <li>Exploitation and inappropriate content are big problems</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I give the internet a rating of <span>6</span> out of 10.</p>
